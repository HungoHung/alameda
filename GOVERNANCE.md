# Alameda Governance

This document defines project governance for the project.

## Principles
The Alameda community adheres to the following principles:

- Open: Alameda is open source. See repository guidelines and [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/), below.
- Welcoming and respectful: See Code of Conduct, below.
- Transparent and accessible: Work and collaboration are done in public.
- Merit: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with project objectives, scope, and design principles.

## Voting
The Alameda project employs "organization voting" to ensure no single organization can dominate the project.

## Memberships
All members enjoy the privileges and undertake the obligations described in this section, as from time to time amended by the Governing
Board.

Founding Member: No conditions (TBD)

Premier Member: TBD

General Member: TBD

Associate Member (pre-approved non-profits, open source projects, and government entities)


## Governing Board
The Governing Board voting members will consist of:

i) one representative appointed by each Founding Member;

ii) one representative appointed by each Premier Member; 

iii) one General Members representative elected by the General Members;

iv) one active contributor to the Alameda open source project designated by the Alameda;
Leadership Team (“Community Representative”), as set forth in the Alameda Open Source project’s governance document; and

v) one Associate Member representative appointed by the Governing Board.

## Maintainership
The Governing Board appoints or removes Maintainers. All Maintainers must comply with the policies made by the Governing Board. 

Each founding member has the right to appoint a maintainer without conditions. New maintainers are proposed by one member of the Governing Board, and are elected by 2/3 majority vote of the Governing Board.

Maintainers can be removed by a 2/3 majority organization vote. 

## Github Project Administration
Maintainers will be added to the Alameda GitHub organization, and added to the GitHub Maintainers team.

After 6 months a maintainer will be made an "owner" of the Alameda GitHub organization.
